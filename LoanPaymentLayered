This is my Loan Data Access Layer (DAL)
 public IEnumerable<LoanPayment> GetloanPaymentListDAL(int customerId)
 {
     try
     {
         //IEnumerable<LoanApplication> loanApplications = new List<LoanApplication>();
         var loanPaymentHistory = (from loan in _context.LoanApplications
                                       //where i.CustomerId == customerId
                                   join loanPayment in _context.LoanPayments on loan.LoanApplicationId equals loanPayment.LoanApplicationId
                                   where loan.CustomerId== customerId&&loan.LoanStatus=="Sanctioned"

                                   select new LoanPayment
                                   {
                                       LoanApplicationId = loanPayment.LoanApplicationId,
                                       PaymentAmount = loanPayment.PaymentAmount,
                                       PaymentId = loanPayment.PaymentId,
                                       TransactionDate = loanPayment.TransactionDate,
                                   }).ToList();

         //IEnumerable<LoanApplication> result = loanApplications.Where(x => x.LoanStatus == "Sanctioned");
         return loanPaymentHistory; 
     }
     catch (Exception ex)
     {
         throw new OnlineBankExceptions(ex.Message);
     }
This is my Loan Business Layer (BL)
 public IEnumerable<LoanPayment> GetloanPaymentListBL(int customerId)
 {
     LoanDAL objDAL = new LoanDAL();
     return objDAL.GetloanPaymentListDAL(customerId);
 }

This is my Loan Asp.Net Core Webi Api Controller
 [HttpGet]
 public IActionResult GetloanPaymentList(int cutomerID)
 {
     LoanBL objBL = new LoanBL();
     var laonPayments = objBL.GetloanPaymentListBL(cutomerID);

     if (!ModelState.IsValid)
     {
         return BadRequest(ModelState);
     }
     //HttpStatusCode objCode;

     return Ok(laonPayments);
 }

I want to create Angular Component,model, service and HTML page for this. This should List "PaymentId","LoanApplicationId","PaymentAmount","TransactionDate" inside a table.
explain how to make the connection from angular to web api controller
